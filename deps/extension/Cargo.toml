# sha2's asm implementation uses standalone .S files that aren't compiled correctly on Windows,
# and aren't linked correctly on x86 Android.
# This will be fixed in sha2 0.11, which also removes the "asm" feature and turns it on by default.
# So when sha2 0.11 is released, this section will go away.
